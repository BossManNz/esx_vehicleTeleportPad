# Credits
`ElPumpo` for the upload of this script, without this I could not have modified the script. `TheStonedTurtle` for the ground detection function. `BossManNz` for the modification of this script. If I have missed anyone please contact me.

# Disclaimer
This is not my script, I simply used resources available on the FiveM forums. I do not own this script nor do I claim to have created it. I just figured I would release this as many people ask about this sort of thing.

# Description
This is a very modular vehicle teleport pad script for ESX (you can also simply just teleport people without a vehicle if you wish). You can very easily add new vehicle teleport pads in `config.lua`. This is not my script, I simply used resources available on the FiveM forums. This version incorporates TheStonedTurtle's ground detection function from the Mello Trainer.

## Installation
- Add this to your `server.cfg`:

```
start esx_vehicleTeleportPads
```

### License
